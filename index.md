# Welcome to Nathaniel Kai Eubanks' Personal Page! 

I hope to share neat tidbits of my projects, those that exist upon the glowing screen which life revolves around, as well as less computer-focused activities.  I hope you enjoy the journey!


### Short Bio
My name is Nathaniel Kai Eubanks, but I generally am called `Kai`.  My location fluctuates as does that of most people, but generally has centered around Northern Virginia my whole life.  I enjoyed a childhood of exploring the woods and drainage ditches with friends, creating technical drawings of imagined machinery, and some light "coding" (Flash).  Since then I have attended Mr. Jefferson's high school (TJHSST) and Mr. Jefferson's university (UVA, Engineering School / Computer Science).  At these fine institutions, I have taken many classes with wonderful topics which helped me grow my skills.  In addition to these classes, I got some great industry experience through a bunch of internships.  

After my humble beginnings, I took up employment with Applied Predictive Technologies, a part of Mastercard.  I find myself very fortunate to live in an era of unparalleled software horizons: I get to work on building cool software to analyze transaction data and retail/banking data!

Outside of work, I enjoy `{woodworking, music, cycling, exploring new things}` - I hope to share those passions as well.

## My Personal Work

### Software
I enjoy software creation because of the ability to create cool things where before there was only empty canvas.

#### HexRail
![Terrain and Paths Generator](/img/CS_HexRailSample.png)
1. Creates heightmaps
2. Finds flat regions to build cities
3. Finds short routes between cities while avoiding too many mountains and oceans
4. One day trains will run on these tracks, but the code for that needs to be polished some more.

Coming soon - a javascript version for in-browser use!

More Projects incoming!

### Crafts
In addition to dumpster diving as a source of items to fill my apartment, I like to create knickknacks and furniture with my hands.

#### Violin

I enjoy woodworking, music, and scavanging - to combine these joys, I decided to recreate my Intro to Engineering project (Cigarbox violin with 3D printed parts) using:
1. random logs found on the beach (fingerboard, neck, body) - notice the gorgeous spalting caused by fungi
2. a branch I cut off an eastern cedar tree (pegs, bridge, tailpiece) - will be extremely fragrant and a gorgeous purple color for only a month or so

#### `Data is the New Oil` Commerative  Sculture
![Oil pumpjack model on shelf](/img/CRAFT_dataIsNewOil.jpg)
To celebrate data being the new oil (and other buzz phrases at work), I decided to make a pumpjack which also serves as a fidget toy (rotates with finger motion).  This lives on a shelf I made to hold knickknacks above my monitor at the office.

Eventually I will add paintings and other crafts.


### The Joys of Cycling
The bike goes faster than feet: An analysis of journeys

My favorite journeys are:
* W&OD - 45 miles out, 45 miles back, plus some more miles to bike there = a great imperial century with a joyous gradient of city to countryside.
* C&O Canal - 184.5 miles one way on gravel.  Great camping over a week with my dad.  Not for road bikes.  (This can also be used to get to the billy goat trail for an after-work hike)
* Arlington Loop - 17 miles around the city, and you get to see airplanes land as well as get close to the water treatment plant

### Music
Violin, Ukulele, Reed Organ, Clarinet

(This page is still growing, much like a parasitic insect.  Personal projects will be polished, made more interactive if possible, and then added here.)

### Dreaming of Big Projects to Come
What is next?  Only time shall tell!
(Possibly some data science, and definitely some more personal projects added to my public repos!)
