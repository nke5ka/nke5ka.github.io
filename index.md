# Welcome to Nathaniel Kai Eubanks' Personal Page! 

I hope to share neat tidbits of my projects: those that exist upon the glowing screen which life revolves around, as well as less computer-focused activities.  I hope you enjoy the journey!

### Short Bio
My name is Nathaniel Kai Eubanks, but I generally am called `Kai`.  My location fluctuates as does that of most people, but generally has centered around Northern Virginia my whole life.  I enjoyed a childhood of exploring the woods and drainage ditches with friends, creating technical drawings of imagined machinery, and some light "coding" (Flash, BASIC).  Since then I have attended Mr. Jefferson's high school (TJHSST) and Mr. Jefferson's university (UVA, Engineering School / Computer Science).  At these fine institutions, I have taken many classes with wonderful topics which helped me grow my skills.  In addition to these classes, I got some great industry experience through a bunch of internships.

After my humble beginnings, I took up employment with Applied Predictive Technologies, which then became a part of Mastercard.  During my time there I loved the friends I made, and learned a lot while writing software to analyze transaction data and retail/banking data!  Recently, I started work at Youtube (The world's #2 search engine, whose parent company (Google) owns the #1 search engine).  I find my work there fascinating and impactful - this leads to satisfaction of the soul.  I find myself very fortunate to live in an era of unparalleled software horizons.

Outside of work, I enjoy `{coding, woodworking, music, cycling, exploring new things}` - I hope to share those passions as well.

# My Personal Work in the Software Space
I enjoy software creation because of the ability to create cool things where before there was only empty canvas.

## HexRail
![Terrain and Paths Generator](/img/CS_HexRailSample.png)
1. Creates heightmaps
2. Finds flat regions to build cities
3. Finds short routes between cities while avoiding too many mountains and oceans
4. One day trains will run on these tracks, but the code for that needs to be polished some more.

Check it out here: <https://github.com/nke5ka/HexRail_Legacy>  

Also coming soon - a javascript version for in-browser use!

## Small Toys / Ideas
This section is for programs which are currently small and quick, and don't yet have nice visuals.

Name | Quick Description
---|---
Turing Machine | I wished Turing machines were taught more physically in college, rather than so abstractly.  Hopefully one day this will also have documentation on building a mechanical Turing machine from wood <https://github.com/nke5ka/TuringMachine>
Graph Theory Visualizations | My next project!
More toys coming soon! | ???

## More Projects incoming!
Slowly I am going into my archive of personal projects on various old computers and hopefully transfer the more interesting ones into Github to be viewable forever.  I will try to focus on having interactive programs where possible.
* A rewrite using Javascript of the ray tracing program that I wrote in high school
![Ray tracing sun rises](/img/CS_raytrace.gif)
* A rewrite using Javascript of the physics simulator program that I wrote in high school - the revisit is inspired by The Three-Body Problem/Remembrance of Earth's Past book trilogy
![Nodes disperse but linked together](/img/CS_physicsNodes.gif)
* Something Machine Learning based
* Something computer vision based
* Clothing-related data science project

### Dreaming of Big Projects to Come
What is next?  Only time shall tell!
