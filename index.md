# Welcome to Nathaniel Kai Eubanks' Personal Page! 

I hope to share neat tidbits of my projects, those that exist upon the glowing screen which life revolves around, as well as less computer-focused activities.  I hope you enjoy the journey!


### Short Bio
My name is Nathaniel Kai Eubanks, but I generally am called `Kai`.  My location fluctuates as does that of most people, but generally has centered around Northern Virginia my whole life.  I enjoyed a childhood of exploring the woods and drainage ditches with friends, creating technical drawings of imagined machinery, and some light "coding" (Flash).  Since then I have attended Mr. Jefferson's high school (TJHSST) and Mr. Jefferson's university (UVA, Engineering School / Computer Science).  At these fine institutions, I have taken many classes with wonderful topics which helped me grow my skills.  In addition to these classes, I got some great industry experience through a bunch of internships.  

After my humble beginnings, I took up employment with Applied Predictive Technologies, a part of Mastercard.  I find myself very fortunate to live in an era of unparalleled software horizons: I get to work on building cool software to analyze transaction data and retail/banking data!

Outside of work, I enjoy `{woodworking, music, cycling, exploring new things}` - I hope to share those passions as well.
