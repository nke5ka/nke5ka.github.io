# Intro to Crafts
In addition to dumpster diving as a source of items to fill my apartment, I like to create knickknacks and furniture with my hands.  Feel free to send an email with any cool ideas or to share any of your work!

# Wood

## Violin

I enjoy woodworking, music, and scavenging - to combine these joys, I decided to recreate my Intro to Engineering project (Cigarbox violin with 3D printed parts) using:
1. random logs found on the beach (fingerboard, neck, body) - notice the gorgeous spalting caused by fungi
2. a branch I chainsawed off an eastern cedar tree (pegs, bridge, tailpiece) - sadly it remained extremely fragrant and a gorgeous purple color for only a month or so

## `Data is the New Oil` Commemorative Sculpture
![Oil pumpjack model on shelf](/img/CRAFT_dataIsNewOil.jpg)
To celebrate data being the new oil (and other buzz phrases at work), I decided to make a pumpjack which also serves as a fidget toy (rotates with finger motion).  This lives on a shelf I made to hold knickknacks above my monitor at the office.

## Some more pieces of wood will be found and put here


# 3D Printing (WIP)
I purchased a Ender 3 V2 quite recently and am impressed with the print quality.  I got lucky with not having issues.
My main workflow is:
1. Find/Design Models
2. Set the layer height
3. Use a small brim instead of the default skirt for small or complex pieces
4. Print!
5. Babysit the first layer
6. Every now and then glance over to ensure success.

## The Era of Test Prints (1, 2)
I printed the default dog (1) which came with the printer.  The huge raft is a waste of plastic and print time.  Afterwards I printed the standard benchy (2) which came out smooth and nice.

## Radial Engine (3)
I love model engines, and this air balloon motor has sparked a lot of joy.  Some pieces snapped when putting together, and I tried to use rubber seals to prevent leaks, but I enjoyed this nonetheless.  Unfortunately, I'll need to tinker with this more before it can be balloon powered.  I tried using balloons that were too tight which gave me a headache.

Todo: gif of rotation

## Anemometer (4)
Part of weather station.
Todo: Add picture

## Wind Up Car (5)
Need to sand the gears better using smaller files and reassemble.  Some pieces snapped during assembly, and needed to be "soldered"/"welded" using scrap plastic and a soldering iron.  Runs but not as smoothly as I would like.  Would have liked to not have printed the waste plastic, but there was no easy list of required parts.

## Gimbal (6 x3)
Gifts for friends, and a fidget toy for myself.  Needed some sanding but spins VERY smoothly.
Not sure if it is this one or another one: <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:802145>

## Tippee Top (7)
Gift for friend.  Works pretty well if given enough flat space.  Spins until it flips upside down.

## Brio-compatible joint stress-relieving train tracks and Brio&lego-compatible train (8)
Gifts for girlfriend's sisters.

## Totoro model (9)
Gift for friend

## Topographical map of Tucson (10)
Gift for relative, possibly got lost in the mail

## Steam Engine Powered by Balloon (WIP 11)
Some pieces catch, but not fully assembled yet.

## Lego Compatible Era (12)
Using LDraw and converting to stl works sometimes, but other times the holes are filled in weird.
Failed universal joint (62520c01): small base led to piece falling over.
Various clutch pieces (look up all the gears, connectors, etc. part numbers) - dreamed of use in transmission, but lives inside of a lego orrery now (TODO writeup and link)
Small turntable (Orrery)

I then realized I could buy these pieces for pennies each...

## Clock
Still in the search phase.  I have a spreadsheet of candidates but might design my own variant of available pendulum clocks.

# Pen and Painting-based Art
Several paintings will be here one day

# Lego

## Flight sim controller
MSFS2020 with keyboard is inferior to controller-based flying.
TODO: add pictures, finish and polish
Lego - Done.
Electronics - Done.
Code - To finalize.
vJoy vs unoJoy design decisions.

## AROCS Pneumatic Truck
Review to be done hopefully this weekend.

# Paper/Cardboard

## Submarine
Complete! TODO: add images
At some point my classification scheme will get weirder yet (if I make a forts section, this will move there)

## Cessna
