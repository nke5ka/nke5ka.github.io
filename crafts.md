# Intro to Crafts
In addition to dumpster diving as a source of items to fill my apartment, I like to create knickknacks and furniture with my hands.  Feel free to send an email with any cool ideas or to share any of your work!

# Wood

## Violin

I enjoy woodworking, music, and scavenging - to combine these joys, I decided to recreate my Intro to Engineering project (Cigarbox violin with 3D printed parts) using:
1. random logs found on the beach (fingerboard, neck, body) - notice the gorgeous spalting caused by fungi
2. a branch I chainsawed off an eastern cedar tree (pegs, bridge, tailpiece) - sadly it remained extremely fragrant and a gorgeous purple color for only a month or so

## `Data is the New Oil` Commemorative Sculpture
![Oil pumpjack model on shelf](/img/CRAFT_dataIsNewOil.jpg)
To celebrate data being the new oil (and other buzz phrases at work), I decided to make a pumpjack which also serves as a fidget toy (rotates with finger motion).  This lives on a shelf I made to hold knickknacks above my monitor at the office.
