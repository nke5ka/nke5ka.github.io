# Things that leave no proof
Ephemeral actions like exercise and music are great and sad at the same time, each note or push lives but for a moment - mistakes and triumphs alike disappear as soon as they happen.

# The Joys of Cycling
There are many biking opportunities in Arlington!  My fleet currently consists of the following bikes:  
* A Cannondale road bike
* Trek Fuel mountain bike
* A heavy old bike (no worrying about theft or damage)

The combination of pedal power, gleaming machine, and maintenance schedules brings immense joy.  Buying used and doing your own repairs makes biking an affordable way to tour the great outdoors.

My favorite journeys are:  
* W&OD - 45 miles out, 45 miles back, plus some more miles to bike there = a great imperial century with a joyous gradient of city to countryside.
* C&O Canal - 184.5 miles one way on gravel.  Great camping over a week with my dad.  Not for road bikes.  (This can also be used to get to the billy goat trail for an after-work hike)
* Arlington Loop - 17 miles around the city, and you get to see airplanes land as well as get close to the water treatment plant

Soon (a few months, years?) I shall publish my list of must-dos in the Bay Area once I move there
